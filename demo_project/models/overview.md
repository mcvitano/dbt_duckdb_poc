# Welcome!  
This is a simple project for demoonstration purposes.  
  
# Project Tab
  
The `Project` tab mirrors the project's directory structure  
  
# Database Tab
  
The `Database` tab exposes the same information as the `Project` tab but in a format that looks more like a database explorer, grouping relations (tables and views) into database schemas. Currently, this project contains a single schema (main) plus three sources.  
  
# Graph Exploration  
  
The blue-green button in the bottom-right corner displays the linear graph of all models.  
  
To apply filters (e.g., tags) click *Update Graph*. Left-clicking a model highlights its parents and children. Right-clicking a model exposes similar filtering options (e.g., hide node and its parents or children).
